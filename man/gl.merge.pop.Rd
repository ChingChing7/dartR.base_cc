\description{
Individuals are assigned to populations based on the specimen metadata data
file (csv) used with gl.read.dart().
This function assigns individuals from two nominated populations into a new
single population. It can also be used to rename populations.
The function works with both SNP and Tag P/A (silicoDArT) data.
The function returns a genlight object with the new population assignments.
