\description{
A function to edit names of individual in a dartR genlight object, or to create a
reassignment table taking the individual labels from a genlight object, or to
edit existing individual labels in an existing recode_ind file. The amended 
recode table is then applied to the genlight object.
}
\details{
Renaming individuals may be required when there have been errors in labeling
 arising in the passage of samples to sequencing. There may be occasions
 where renaming individuals is required for preparation of figures. 

This function will input an existing recode table for editing and optionally
save it as a new table, or if the name of an input table is not supplied,
will generate a table using the individual labels in the parent genlight
object.

When caution needs to be exercised because of the potential for breaking the
'chain of evidence' associated with the samples, recoding individuals using
a recode table (csv) can provide a durable record of the changes.

For SNP genotype data, the function, having deleted individuals, optionally 
identifies resultant monomorphic loci or loci with all values missing 
and deletes them. The script also optionally recalculates the
locus metadata as appropriate. The optional deletion of monomorphic loci
and the optional recalculation of locus statistics is not available for
Tag P/A data (SilicoDArT).

Use outpath=getwd() when calling this function to direct
output files to your working directory.

The function returns a dartR genlight object with the new population assignments  
and the recalculated locus metadata.

\code{\link{utils.recalc.avgpic
A utility function to recalculate the OneRatioRef, OneRatioSnp, PICRef, PICSnp,
 and AvgPIC by locus after some individuals or populations have been deleted.

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has OneRatioRef, OneRatioSnp, PICRef,
 PICSnp, and AvgPIC included, but the allelic composition will change when
 some individuals,or populations, are removed from the dataset and so the
 initial statistics will no longer apply. This script recalculates these
 statistics and places the recalculated values in the appropriate place in
 the genlight object.

If the locus metadata OneRatioRef|Snp, PICRef|Snp and/or AvgPIC do not exist,
 the script creates and populates them.}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.callrate
A utility script to recalculate the callrate by locus after some populations
have been deleted

SNP datasets generated by DArT have missing values primarily arising from
failure to call a SNP because of a mutation at one or both of the
restriction enzyme recognition sites. The locus metadata supplied by DArT has
 callrate included, but the call rate will change when some individuals are
 removed from the dataset. This script recalculates the callrate and places
 these recalculated values in the appropriate place in the genlight object.
 It sets the Call Rate flag to TRUE.}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.freqhets
A utility script to recalculate the frequency of the heterozygous SNPs by
locus after some populations have been deleted

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has FreqHets included, but the frequency
 of the heterozygotes will change when some individuals are removed from the
 dataset.

This script recalculates the FreqHets and places these recalculated values in
 the appropriate place in the genlight object.

Note that the frequency of the homozygote reference SNPS is calculated from
the individuals that could be scored.}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.freqhomsnp
A utility function to recalculate the frequency of the homozygous alternate
SNP by locus after some populations have been deleted

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has FreqHomSnp included, but the
frequency of the homozygous alternate will change when some individuals are
removed from the dataset.

This function recalculates the FreqHomSnp and places these recalculated values
 in the appropriate place in the genlight object.

Note that the frequency of the homozygote alternate SNPS is calculated from
the individuals that could be scored.

This function only applies to SNP genotype data not Tag P/A data (SilicoDArT).}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.maf
A utility script to recalculate the minor allele frequency by locus,
typically after some populations have been deleted

The locus metadata supplied by DArT does not have MAF included, so it is
calculated and added to the locus.metadata by this script. The minimum allele
frequency will change when some individuals are removed from the dataset.
This script recalculates the MAF and places these recalculated values in the
 appropriate place in the genlight object.
 
 This function only applies to SNP genotype data.}},
\code{\link{utils.reset.flags
A utility function to reset to FALSE (or TRUE) the locus metric flags after
some individuals or populations have been deleted.

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has OneRatioRef, OneRatioSnp, PICRef,
PICSnp, and AvgPIC included, but the allelic composition will change when
some individuals are removed from the dataset and so the initial statistics
will no longer apply. This applies also to some variable calculated by dartR
(e.g. maf). This script resets the locus metrics flags to FALSE to indicate
that these statistics in the genlight object are no longer current. The
verbosity default is also set, and in the case of SilcoDArT, the flags PIC
and OneRatio are also set.

If the locus metrics do not exist then they are added to the genlight object
 but not populated. If the locus metrics flags do not exist, then they are
 added to the genlight object and set to FALSE (or TRUE).}},
