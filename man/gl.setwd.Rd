\description{
Many dartR functions have a plot.dir parameter which is used to save output to (e.g. ggplots as rds files)
 With this functions users can set the working directory globally so it is used in all functions, without setting is explicitely. 
 The value for wd is stored in the r environment and if not set defaults to tempdir(). This script sets the default value.

#set to current working directory
gl <- gl.setwd(wd=getwd())
