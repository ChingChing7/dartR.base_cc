\title{Selects shapes from the base R shape palette and outputs as a vector}
\usage{
gl.select.shapes(x = NULL, select = NULL, verbose = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Optionally, provide a gl object from which to determine the number
of populations [default NULL].}

\item{select}{Select the shapes to retain in the output vector
[default NULL, all shapes shown and returned].}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
[default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity].}
}
\value{
A vector with the required number of shapes
}
\description{
This script draws upon the standard R shape palette to extract a vector of
shapes for plotting, where the script that follows has a shape parameter
expecting a vector of shapes.
}
\details{
By default the shape palette will be displayed in full in the graphics window
from which shapes can be selected in a subsequent run, and the vector of
shapes returned for later use.

The select parameter can be used to select shapes from the specified 26
shapes available (0-25). For example, select=c(1,1,3) will select shape 1, 1
again and 3 to retain in the final vector. This can be useful for fine-tuning
shape selection, and matching colors and shapes.

\examples{
# SET UP DATASET
gl <- testset.gl
levels(pop(gl))<-c(rep('Coast',5),rep('Cooper',3),rep('Coast',5),
rep('MDB',8),rep('Coast',7),'Em.subglobosa','Em.victoriae')
# EXAMPLES
shapes <- gl.select.shapes() # Select and display available shapes
# Select and display a restricted set of shapes
shapes <- gl.select.shapes(select=c(1,1,1,5,8)) 
 # Select set of shapes and check with no. of pops.
shapes <- gl.select.shapes(x=gl,select=c(1,1,1,5,8))

Converts DarT to genlight.
Internal function called by gl.read.dart()}},

\code{\link{utils.recalc.avgpic
A utility function to recalculate the OneRatioRef, OneRatioSnp, PICRef, PICSnp,
 and AvgPIC by locus after some individuals or populations have been deleted.

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has OneRatioRef, OneRatioSnp, PICRef,
 PICSnp, and AvgPIC included, but the allelic composition will change when
 some individuals,or populations, are removed from the dataset and so the
 initial statistics will no longer apply. This script recalculates these
 statistics and places the recalculated values in the appropriate place in
 the genlight object.

If the locus metadata OneRatioRef|Snp, PICRef|Snp and/or AvgPIC do not exist,
 the script creates and populates them.}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.callrate
A utility script to recalculate the callrate by locus after some populations
have been deleted

SNP datasets generated by DArT have missing values primarily arising from
failure to call a SNP because of a mutation at one or both of the
restriction enzyme recognition sites. The locus metadata supplied by DArT has
 callrate included, but the call rate will change when some individuals are
 removed from the dataset. This script recalculates the callrate and places
 these recalculated values in the appropriate place in the genlight object.
 It sets the Call Rate flag to TRUE.}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.freqhets
A utility script to recalculate the frequency of the heterozygous SNPs by
locus after some populations have been deleted

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has FreqHets included, but the frequency
 of the heterozygotes will change when some individuals are removed from the
 dataset.

This script recalculates the FreqHets and places these recalculated values in
 the appropriate place in the genlight object.

Note that the frequency of the homozygote reference SNPS is calculated from
the individuals that could be scored.}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.freqhomsnp
A utility function to recalculate the frequency of the homozygous alternate
SNP by locus after some populations have been deleted

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has FreqHomSnp included, but the
frequency of the homozygous alternate will change when some individuals are
removed from the dataset.

This function recalculates the FreqHomSnp and places these recalculated values
 in the appropriate place in the genlight object.

Note that the frequency of the homozygote alternate SNPS is calculated from
the individuals that could be scored.

This function only applies to SNP genotype data not Tag P/A data (SilicoDArT).}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.maf
A utility script to recalculate the minor allele frequency by locus,
typically after some populations have been deleted

The locus metadata supplied by DArT does not have MAF included, so it is
calculated and added to the locus.metadata by this script. The minimum allele
frequency will change when some individuals are removed from the dataset.
This script recalculates the MAF and places these recalculated values in the
 appropriate place in the genlight object.
 
 This function only applies to SNP genotype data.}},
\code{\link{utils.reset.flags
A utility function to reset to FALSE (or TRUE) the locus metric flags after
some individuals or populations have been deleted.

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has OneRatioRef, OneRatioSnp, PICRef,
PICSnp, and AvgPIC included, but the allelic composition will change when
some individuals are removed from the dataset and so the initial statistics
will no longer apply. This applies also to some variable calculated by dartR
(e.g. maf). This script resets the locus metrics flags to FALSE to indicate
that these statistics in the genlight object are no longer current. The
verbosity default is also set, and in the case of SilcoDArT, the flags PIC
and OneRatio are also set.

If the locus metrics do not exist then they are added to the genlight object
 but not populated. If the locus metrics flags do not exist, then they are
 added to the genlight object and set to FALSE (or TRUE).}},
