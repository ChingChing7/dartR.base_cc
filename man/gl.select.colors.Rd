\title{Selects colors from one of several palettes and output as a vector}
\usage{
gl.select.colors(
  x = NULL,
  library = NULL,
  palette = NULL,
  ncolors = NULL,
  select = NULL,
  verbose = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Optionally, provide a gl object from which to determine the number
of populations [default NULL].}

\item{library}{Name of the color library to be used [default scales::hue_pl].}

\item{palette}{Name of the color palette to be pulled from the specified
library [default is library specific] .}

\item{ncolors}{number of colors to be displayed and returned [default 9].}

\item{select}{select the colors to retain in the output vector
[default NULL].}

\item{verbose}{-- verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
[default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity].}
}
\value{
A vector with the required number of colors
}
\description{
This script draws upon a number of specified color libraries to extract a
vector of colors for plotting, where the script that follows has a color
parameter expecting a vector of colors.
}
\details{
The available color libraries and their palettes include:
\itemize{
\item library 'brewer' and the palettes available can be listed by
RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all() and RColorBrewer::brewer.pal.info.
\item library 'gr.palette' and the palettes available can be listed by
grDevices::palette.pals()
\item library 'r.hcl' and the palettes available can be listed by
grDevices::hcl.pals()
\item library 'baseR' and the palettes available are: 'rainbow','heat',
'topo.colors','terrain.colors','cm.colors'.
}
If the nominated palette is not specified, all the palettes will be listed and a default palette will then be chosen.

The color palette will be displayed in the graphics window for the requested
number of colors (or 9 if not specified),and the vector of colors returned
for later use.

The select parameter can be used to select colors from the specified ncolors.
For example, select=c(1,1,3) will select color 1, 1 again and 3 to retain in
the final vector. This can be useful for fine-tuning color selection, and
matching colors and shapes.

\examples{
# SET UP DATASET
gl <- testset.gl
levels(pop(gl))<-c(rep('Coast',5),rep('Cooper',3),rep('Coast',5),
rep('MDB',8),rep('Coast',7),'Em.subglobosa','Em.victoriae')
# EXAMPLES -- SIMPLE
colors <- gl.select.colors()
colors <- gl.select.colors(library='brewer',palette='Spectral',ncolors=6)
colors <- gl.select.colors(library='baseR',palette='terrain.colors',ncolors=6)
colors <- gl.select.colors(library='baseR',palette='rainbow',ncolors=12)
colors <- gl.select.colors(library='gr.hcl',palette='RdBu',ncolors=12)
colors <- gl.select.colors(library='gr.palette',palette='Pastel 1',ncolors=6)
# EXAMPLES -- SELECTING colorS
colors <- gl.select.colors(library='baseR',palette='rainbow',ncolors=12,select=c(1,1,1,5,8))
# EXAMPLES -- CROSS-CHECKING WITH A GENLIGHT OBJECT
colors <- gl.select.colors(x=gl,library='baseR',palette='rainbow',ncolors=12,select=c(1,1,1,5,8))

\code{\link{utils.dart2genlight
Converts DarT to genlight.
Internal function called by gl.read.dart()}},
\code{\link{utils.read.dart}()},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.avgpic
A utility function to recalculate the OneRatioRef, OneRatioSnp, PICRef, PICSnp,
 and AvgPIC by locus after some individuals or populations have been deleted.

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has OneRatioRef, OneRatioSnp, PICRef,
 PICSnp, and AvgPIC included, but the allelic composition will change when
 some individuals,or populations, are removed from the dataset and so the
 initial statistics will no longer apply. This script recalculates these
 statistics and places the recalculated values in the appropriate place in
 the genlight object.

If the locus metadata OneRatioRef|Snp, PICRef|Snp and/or AvgPIC do not exist,
 the script creates and populates them.}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.callrate
A utility script to recalculate the callrate by locus after some populations
have been deleted

SNP datasets generated by DArT have missing values primarily arising from
failure to call a SNP because of a mutation at one or both of the
restriction enzyme recognition sites. The locus metadata supplied by DArT has
 callrate included, but the call rate will change when some individuals are
 removed from the dataset. This script recalculates the callrate and places
 these recalculated values in the appropriate place in the genlight object.
 It sets the Call Rate flag to TRUE.}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.freqhets
A utility script to recalculate the frequency of the heterozygous SNPs by
locus after some populations have been deleted

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has FreqHets included, but the frequency
 of the heterozygotes will change when some individuals are removed from the
 dataset.

This script recalculates the FreqHets and places these recalculated values in
 the appropriate place in the genlight object.

Note that the frequency of the homozygote reference SNPS is calculated from
the individuals that could be scored.}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.freqhomsnp
A utility function to recalculate the frequency of the homozygous alternate
SNP by locus after some populations have been deleted

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has FreqHomSnp included, but the
frequency of the homozygous alternate will change when some individuals are
removed from the dataset.

This function recalculates the FreqHomSnp and places these recalculated values
 in the appropriate place in the genlight object.

Note that the frequency of the homozygote alternate SNPS is calculated from
the individuals that could be scored.

This function only applies to SNP genotype data not Tag P/A data (SilicoDArT).}},
\code{\link{utils.recalc.maf
A utility script to recalculate the minor allele frequency by locus,
typically after some populations have been deleted

The locus metadata supplied by DArT does not have MAF included, so it is
calculated and added to the locus.metadata by this script. The minimum allele
frequency will change when some individuals are removed from the dataset.
This script recalculates the MAF and places these recalculated values in the
 appropriate place in the genlight object.
 
 This function only applies to SNP genotype data.}},
\code{\link{utils.reset.flags
A utility function to reset to FALSE (or TRUE) the locus metric flags after
some individuals or populations have been deleted.

The locus metadata supplied by DArT has OneRatioRef, OneRatioSnp, PICRef,
PICSnp, and AvgPIC included, but the allelic composition will change when
some individuals are removed from the dataset and so the initial statistics
will no longer apply. This applies also to some variable calculated by dartR
(e.g. maf). This script resets the locus metrics flags to FALSE to indicate
that these statistics in the genlight object are no longer current. The
verbosity default is also set, and in the case of SilcoDArT, the flags PIC
and OneRatio are also set.

If the locus metrics do not exist then they are added to the genlight object
 but not populated. If the locus metrics flags do not exist, then they are
 added to the genlight object and set to FALSE (or TRUE).}},
